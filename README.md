## Dataset
[Ships from Satellite](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery)
- 4000 total samples
    - 1000 Valid
    - 3000 Invalid
    - Imbalanced
- Binary object classification task
- High inter-class variance (cropped images, partial representations, etc)
- Works in conjunction with [Planet Developer Center](https://developers.planet.com/) API Key for additional scene context
- Benefit: "Automating this process can be applied to many issues including monitoring port activity levels and supply chain analysis."
